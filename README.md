An AI Virtual Mouse with Hand movements is a novel programme that enables users to control the computer mouse cursor with hand movements. It was created with the Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pyautogui packages. The application tracks the user's hand motions and converts them into mouse cursor movements using the computer's camera. For computer vision, the OpenCV library is utilised, allowing the programme to recognise and track the user's hand in real-time. The Mediapipe library includes machine learning models that have been pre-trained to identify and recognise hand gestures. The Pyautogui package simulates mouse clicks, allowing users to interact with computers through hand gestures. The application also includes a number of hand gestures that may be used to perform various mouse actions.
